      <li>
        Eventually this OEM free-for-all got codified in the ANSI standard.
      </li>
      <li>In the ANSI standard, everybody agreed on what to do below 128,</li>
      <li>which was pretty much the same as ASCII,</li>
      <li>
        but there were lots of different ways to handle the characters from 128
        and on up,
      </li>
      <li>
        depending on where you lived. These different systems were called code
        pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        So for example in Israel DOS used a code page called 862, while Greek
        users used 737.
      </li>
      <li>
        They were the same below 128 but different from 128 up, where all the
        funny letters resided.
      </li>
    </ul>
